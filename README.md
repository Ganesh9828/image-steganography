# Image Steganography

## Overview

Image Steganography is the practice of hiding secret messages within an image file. This technique can be used for secure communication, watermarking, and data hiding. This repository contains a Python implementation of image steganography that allows users to embed and extract messages from images.

## Features

- Embed text messages within various image formats (e.g., PNG, BMP).
- Extract hidden messages from images.
- Simple command-line interface.
- Supports both encoding and decoding processes.
- Example images and usage instructions included.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-steganography.git
cd image-steganography
```

Then, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Embedding a Message

To embed a message into an image, use the following command:

```bash
python steganography.py embed <image_path> <message>
```

### Extracting a Message

To extract a hidden message from an image, use the following command:

```bash
python steganography.py extract <image_path>
```

## Examples

### Embedding

```bash
python steganography.py embed example.png "Secret Message"
```

### Extracting

```bash
python steganography.py extract example.png
```
